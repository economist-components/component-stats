# component-stats
> Display and group stats

#### TODO

- [ ] Do not do more within here than is expected in a stats-list.
- [x] The header should be moved out as it is related to the text, too.
      However, we need to do this without breaking the itemProp type stuff.
- [x] The header should probably have a `<a name="fragment-identiier" />`.
