# component-stats
> Display and group stats

#### TODO

- [ ] Style based on the styling provided by Alex.
- [x] Move the `stats-list` and the `country` container into different repositories:
  - `component-stats`
  - `component-win-country`
- [ ] `component-win-articlepage` should support an article variant containing statistics.
